# Gun-Detection-Tensorflow-API
Object Detection on a Raspberry PI. Personal Project. I participated with it at TECHALLENGE 2019. 


Short Description:

1.I used TensorFlow API and OpenCV for Object-Detection Algorithms.

2.I used a pretrained model SSD-LITE-COCO.

3.I created a personal library with more than 100 gun photos.

4.I classified them with LabelIMG, converted to labels and TFRecords.

5.I trained the algorithm to recognise them with a Total Loss of 1.5.

6.I adapted the Python Code to detect Guns from the video-stream of my WebCamera connected to the RaspberryPI.
